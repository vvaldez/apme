# APME Agent Configurations

This document defines the specialized agents used in APME development. It is the
operational companion to `CLAUDE.md` (the project constitution). All agents must also
follow [SOP.md](SOP.md), which consolidates security, workflow, code quality, CI, git,
and release procedures into a single actionable reference. Read all three before
touching code.

**User-facing CLI (binary remains `apme`):** **`check`** for assessment, **`remediate`** for applying fixes. Both use the bidirectional `FixSession` RPC under the hood (ADR-039). The **Engine Agent** below owns the internal scan pipeline; that is not the same as the CLI subcommand name.

## Architectural Invariants

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of them will break the system or create
debt that compounds across services. Do **not** work around them — if you think
one needs to change, write an ADR first.

1. **Validators are read-only** (ADR-009). Validators detect; they never modify
   files. Remediation is a separate engine with its own convergence loop.
   The one planned exception is third-party plugins (ADR-042), which may
   implement `Transform` — but that is explicitly scoped outside built-in
   validators and requires its own ADR approval.

2. **gRPC everywhere between backend services** (ADR-001). No REST, no message
   queues, no direct function calls between services. The only HTTP endpoints
   are Galaxy Proxy (PEP 503), Gateway REST (:8080 for external consumers),
   and the UI (:8081, nginx-served SPA).

3. **Async servers with executor discipline** (ADR-007). All gRPC servers use
   `grpc.aio`. Blocking work (engine scan, subprocess calls, venv builds) goes
   through `run_in_executor()`. Never block the event loop.

4. **Unified Validator contract** (`validate.proto`). Every validator implements
   `Validator.Validate` + `Validator.Health`. Adding a validator means
   implementing one RPC and setting an env var — not changing Primary's code.

5. **Stateless engine, persistence at the edge** (ADR-020, ADR-029). The engine
   pod has zero database code. Persistence lives in the Gateway (SQLAlchemy +
   SQLite). The `GrpcReportingSink` is best-effort and health-gated — the scan
   path never blocks on reporting.

6. **Scale pods, not individual services** (ADR-012). The engine runtime is a
   unit: Primary + all validators + Galaxy Proxy. In the reference Podman pod,
   Gateway, UI, and Abbenay share the same pod for convenience, but the scaling
   invariant applies to the engine/validator stack: horizontal scaling replicates
   that stack as a unit. Do not extract individual validators into separate
   deployments.

7. **Session venvs are Primary-owned** (ADR-022). Primary is the single writer
   to `/sessions`. Ansible validator mounts it read-only. No other service
   writes to venvs.

8. **Rule IDs follow ADR-008**: `L` = Lint, `M` = Modernize, `R` = Risk,
   `P` = Policy, `SEC` = Secrets (via Gitleaks). Plugin rules use `EXT-` prefix
   (ADR-042).

9. **OPA uses subprocess, not REST** (verified in code). The OPA validator
   invokes `opa eval` via subprocess — there is no OPA REST server on 8181.
   Do not introduce httpx or HTTP client dependencies for OPA.

10. **`FixSession` is the unified client path** (ADR-039). Both `check` and
    `remediate` use the bidirectional `FixSession` RPC. The unary `Scan` RPC
    exists for backward-compatible engine-aligned clients only. New features
    target `FixSession`.

11. **The engine never queries out; it only emits** (ADR-020, ADR-029). The
    engine does not fetch data from external sources, third-party APIs, or any
    system outside its pod. Context enrichment — metadata, external lookups,
    additional data sources — is the **Gateway's responsibility**. The Gateway
    assembles the full request context before calling the engine. The one
    outbound path is the **event sink abstraction** (`event_emitter`), which
    pushes fire-and-forget events via gRPC to the Gateway's Reporting service.
    Sinks are best-effort, health-gated, and never in the scan critical path.
    New sinks must be gRPC and pod-local — protocol translation to external
    systems (message buses, webhooks, third-party APIs) belongs in the Gateway.

12. **Engine-core services are required, not optional.** The engine runtime
    comprises Primary, Native, OPA, Ansible, and Galaxy Proxy. All five are
    required for both the CLI daemon and the Podman pod — their dependencies
    belong in core `dependencies` (not optional extras), and they live in
    `_DEFAULT_PORTS`. Galaxy Proxy is the sole collection installation path
    for session venvs; the daemon cannot scan without it. Only Gitleaks is
    truly optional (`_OPTIONAL_SERVICES`) because it requires an external
    binary. Gateway, UI, and Abbenay are pod-level / enterprise services
    that the CLI daemon does not start.

13. **Transforms are semantically trusted; the engine owns state and syntax**
    (ADR-044). Transforms operate on an **ephemeral copy** of the graph and
    files through a constrained public API (`TransformSession`). They read
    nodes, modify YAML via tracked methods (`modify_node`), and `submit()`
    a changeset. Changes take effect only on submit — a transform that
    fails mid-execution has no effect on the working state (transaction
    safety). The engine merges submitted changesets, validates syntax
    (well-formed YAML), tracks state (NodeState, progression, content
    hashes), detects inheritance propagation (`PropertyOrigin`), and
    enforces structural invariants (topology stability, DAG). The engine
    does **not** validate the semantic correctness of transform changes —
    whether a fix is appropriate for a given module, which children need
    compensation for inherited property changes, or whether a heuristic
    covered all cases. That domain knowledge lives in the transform, not
    the engine. This complements invariant 1 (validators are read-only):
    validators own "what's wrong," transforms own "how to fix it," the
    engine owns "orchestrate and verify structure." New rules and
    transforms are added without engine changes.

14. **Built-in validator bundles are closed** (ADR-042). No volume-mounted rules,
    no configurable rule directories, no external Rego files injected into the
    OPA bundle, no custom Python rule classes loaded into Native. The built-in
    rule set ships with the image and is the only rule set the built-in
    validators execute. Custom/organization-specific rules go through the
    **Plugin service** (ADR-042) as a separate container — never mixed into
    built-in validators.

15. **tox is the sole orchestration tool** (ADR-047). All lint, test, build,
    and pod commands go through `tox -e <env>`. **Never invoke `pytest`, `ruff`,
    `mypy`, `prek`, or shell scripts directly.** Pass extra arguments after
    `--` (e.g. `tox -e unit -- -k test_sbom`). In CI, use
    `uvx --with tox-uv tox -e <env>`. See `.agents/skills/tox/SKILL.md` for
    the full environment reference.

## Handoff Protocol

When transitioning between agents:

1. **Completing Agent**:
   - Update task status to `Complete`
   - Document any deviations from spec
   - Note open questions for next agent
   - Verify no architectural invariants were violated (see list above)

2. **Receiving Agent**:
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for project constitution
   - Read `SOP.md` for consolidated operating procedures
   - Read this file's **Architectural Invariants** section
   - Read relevant REQ and TASK specs
   - Read relevant ADRs (linked from REQ and this file)
   - Check for notes from previous agent
   - Continue from documented state

## Design Thinking

### Sunk cost fallacy

Do not defend existing code simply because effort was invested in it. If a
fix requires increasingly complex workarounds — offset detection, heuristic
correction, retry loops — the underlying abstraction is likely wrong.
Discard the existing approach and redesign the interface.

**Two workarounds for the same interface = redesign the interface.**

### Design LLM contracts around LLM strengths

Never ask an LLM to be precise about line numbers, character offsets, or
positional arithmetic. LLMs are good at understanding and transforming
text. Design contracts where the LLM returns **content** and we handle
**positioning** and reassembly.

### Treat directional feedback as architectural

When a human says "we're too coupled to X" or "why do we need Y," treat
it as an architectural concern, not a narrow bug. Step back to first
principles before writing code. Ask: *"What would this look like if we
didn't have X at all?"*

### Two failed attempts = wrong abstraction

If the same class of failure recurs after two fix attempts, do not attempt
a third fix at the same level. Escalate to a design review of the
interface itself. The pattern of repeated failure is the evidence.

### Dependency direction is sacred

The engine depends on nothing outside its pod. The Gateway depends on
the engine. The UI depends on the Gateway. **Never** invert these arrows.
If you find yourself importing `apme_gateway` from `apme_engine`, or
having the engine call back to the Gateway, stop — you are violating
ADR-020 and ADR-029.

### When in doubt, read the ADR

Every major design choice has an ADR in `.sdlc/adrs/`. If you are about to
make a decision that affects service boundaries, communication patterns,
data flow, or deployment topology, check the ADR index first. If no ADR
covers it, write one before implementing.

## Quality Assurance

All agents must:

1. Follow the spec exactly
2. Run verification steps via **tox only** (invariant 15):
   - `tox -e lint` — lint, format, typecheck
   - `tox -e unit` — unit tests with coverage
   - `tox -e grpc` — after proto changes
3. Update task status
4. Commit with proper message format (Conventional Commits)
5. Flag any spec ambiguities
6. Verify no architectural invariants (above) were violated
7. Follow operating procedures in `SOP.md` (security, git workflow, PR process, release)

### Prohibited direct invocations

**Do not run any of these directly. Use the corresponding tox environment.**

| Prohibited | Use instead |
|------------|-------------|
| `pytest ...` | `tox -e unit -- ...` |
| `ruff check ...` | `tox -e lint` |
| `ruff format ...` | `tox -e lint` |
| `mypy ...` | `tox -e lint` |
| `prek run ...` | `tox -e lint` |
| `./scripts/gen_grpc.sh` | `tox -e grpc` |
| `./containers/podman/build.sh` | `tox -e build` |
| `./containers/podman/up.sh` | `tox -e up` |
| `./containers/podman/down.sh` | `tox -e down` |
| `./containers/podman/run-cli.sh` | `tox -e cli` |
