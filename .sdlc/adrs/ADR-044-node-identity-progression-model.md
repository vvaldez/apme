# ADR-044: Node Identity and Progression Model

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-03-27

## Context

APME's convergence loop (format → scan → transform → rescan, up to 5 passes) treats each scan as a stateless snapshot. The ARI engine, integrated per ADR-003, rebuilds the entire tree from scratch on every pass. No node carries identity across passes and no node records what happened to it over time.

This creates a two-dimensional problem that the current architecture models in only one dimension:

- **Vertical (hierarchy)**: The tree of plays, roles, blocks, tasks — well-modeled by ARI.
- **Horizontal (progression)**: How each node changes through formatting, Tier 1 transforms, AI proposals, and re-scans — not modeled at all.

### Where the gap hurts today

1. **Snippet accuracy**: Source snippets must show the file content at the moment a violation was found. The current `_attach_snippets` implementation uses `File` protos from the scan pipeline, which contain post-format content. Line numbers from validators reference the same post-format files. The snippets are internally consistent but show the user transformed code they didn't write, with no way to trace back to the original.

2. **Violation identity across passes**: Violations are matched between passes by `(rule_id, file, line)` tuples. After a Tier 1 transform shifts line numbers, this heuristic breaks. The remediation engine uses YAML paths as a more stable proxy (`NodeIndex`), but this is a workaround bolted onto a model that lacks first-class identity.

3. **Remediation attribution**: "Which transform fixed which violation?" is answered by inference (diff the violation sets between passes), not by direct tracking. There is no per-node change log.

4. **Parallel representations**: The same content exists in three forms — ARI's in-memory tree (for hierarchy/scandata), `StructuredFile` (ruamel.yaml, for Tier 1 transforms), and raw bytes on disk (for validator fan-out). These are synchronized by writing to disk and re-parsing, not by a shared identity model.

5. **Feedback quality**: When a user reports a false positive, we cannot include "this node was formatted on pass 0, violation V detected on pass 1, transform T attempted on pass 2, violation persisted on pass 3" because that history doesn't exist.

### The puzzle piece analogy

Consider 100 uniquely shaped puzzle pieces handed to 100 people who each make a change and document the color. At any point the puzzle can be reassembled. When everyone is done, every piece has a history of progression. The puzzle's integrity is preserved because identity is intrinsic to each piece, not derived from its position.

APME's current model is: disassemble the puzzle, throw away all the pieces, rebuild new pieces from the table surface, and hope the positions match.

### Decision drivers

- Remediation convergence requires tracking "same node, different state" across passes
- User-facing features (snippets, feedback, audit trails) need temporal context
- The formatter, scan engine, and remediation engine should share one model, not three
- ARI's parsing and hierarchy logic is valuable; its stateless snapshot model is not

## Decision

**We will build a purpose-built Node Identity and Progression Model that wraps ARI's parsing capabilities in an entity-with-history abstraction.**

Each meaningful unit of Ansible content (task, play, block, role reference, variable declaration) receives a stable identity at parse time. That identity persists through formatting, scanning, and remediation passes. Each node accumulates a progression log of state changes.

### Core concepts

**NodeIdentity**: A stable identifier derived from the node's structural position (YAML path) in the original, pre-format content. Identity is assigned once and never changes, even as line numbers shift.

**NodeState**: The content, violations, and metadata of a node at a specific point in time. Immutable once created.

**Progression**: An ordered sequence of `NodeState` entries for a single `NodeIdentity`, representing how that node evolved through the pipeline.

**ContentGraph**: The top-level container — a graph of identified nodes with their progressions. Replaces the current pattern of disconnected ARI tree + StructuredFile + file bytes.

### Pipeline with progression

```
Phase 0 — Parse original files
  → Assign NodeIdentity to every node
  → Record NodeState[0]: original content, no violations

Phase 1 — Format
  → Apply formatter to each node's content
  → Record NodeState[1]: formatted content, diff from original

Phase 2..N — Scan + Transform (convergence)
  → ARI parse of current content (reusing its hierarchy/scandata logic)
  → Map ARI results back to identified nodes (by YAML path)
  → Record NodeState[N]: violations detected
  → Apply Tier 1 transforms
  → Record NodeState[N+1]: post-transform content, which violations resolved
  → Re-scan for convergence check
  → Continue until stable

Phase Final — Classification
  → Each node's progression is complete
  → Remaining violations carry their full history
  → Snippets are trivially extracted from any NodeState in the progression
```

### Relationship to ARI

ARI remains the parser and hierarchy builder. Its `run_scan` produces the hierarchy payload and scandata that validators consume. The change is:

- **Before**: ARI's output is the truth; files on disk are synchronized to match
- **After**: The `ContentGraph` is the truth; ARI is invoked as a service to parse content and produce hierarchy, but its output is mapped back onto identified nodes rather than used as the canonical model

This preserves ARI's valuable parsing logic while decoupling APME from ARI's stateless snapshot assumption.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Extend ARI with identity tracking

**Description**: Modify the vendored ARI engine internals to assign stable node IDs and carry them across `evaluate()` calls.

**Pros**:
- Single model (ARI's tree gains identity)
- No new abstraction layer

**Cons**:
- Deep coupling to ARI internals that were not designed for this
- ARI's `evaluate()` rebuilds trees from scratch by design — retrofitting identity means fighting its architecture
- Makes future ARI updates (porting upstream improvements) much harder
- ARI's node model (scandata, AnsibleRunContext) is optimized for rule evaluation, not lifecycle tracking

**Why not chosen**: Retrofitting identity into a stateless-by-design system creates more complexity than building a clean abstraction. Two workarounds for the same interface means redesign the interface.

### Alternative 2: Thin identity layer between ARI and remediation

**Description**: Keep ARI as-is. Build a `NodeRegistry` that maps YAML paths to stable IDs and maintains progression logs outside ARI. The existing `NodeIndex` is a primitive version of this.

**Pros**:
- Minimal changes to ARI
- Incremental adoption — can add identity tracking without rewriting the pipeline
- Lower initial effort

**Cons**:
- Two sources of truth (ARI's tree + the registry) that must be kept in sync
- YAML-path-based identity is fragile when transforms restructure content
- The three-representation problem (ARI tree, StructuredFile, file bytes) persists
- Every new feature must bridge between ARI's model and the registry

**Why not chosen**: This is the path of least resistance but accumulates the most long-term debt. It codifies the current workaround pattern rather than resolving the underlying model mismatch. Viable as a stepping stone but not as the target architecture.

### Alternative 3: Purpose-built model wrapping ARI (chosen)

**Description**: Build a `ContentGraph` that owns node identity and progression. Use ARI's parsing as an internal service for hierarchy building and rule evaluation, but map results back onto the graph rather than treating ARI's output as the canonical model.

**Pros**:
- Clean single source of truth for node identity, content, and history
- Snippets, attribution, and feedback are natural properties of the model
- Eliminates the three-representation synchronization problem
- ARI's parsing logic is preserved without coupling to its lifecycle assumptions
- Clearer design — the model matches the problem domain

**Cons**:
- Significant implementation effort
- Requires careful migration of existing pipeline code
- ARI integration becomes an adapter layer rather than direct use
- Risk of over-engineering if progression tracking proves less valuable than anticipated

## Consequences

### Positive

- Every violation carries a snippet from the exact content state when it was detected
- Violation identity is stable across passes — no more (file, line) heuristic matching
- Remediation attribution is explicit: "Transform T resolved violation V on node N at pass P"
- Feedback issues include full node progression (original → formatted → scanned → transformed)
- Single model serves parsing, validation, remediation, and reporting
- Formatter changes become trackable events, not invisible preprocessing

### Negative

- Large implementation effort spanning engine, remediation, and primary server
- ARI becomes an internal service with an adapter, adding indirection
- Migration must be carefully staged to avoid breaking the existing pipeline
- Additional memory for storing node progressions (bounded by pass count × node count)

### Neutral

- ARI's parsing and hierarchy-building code is unchanged — only its consumption model changes
- The gRPC contract between Primary and validators is unaffected (validators still receive `ValidateRequest`)
- The `Violation` proto gains a stable `node_id` field but remains backward-compatible

## Implementation Notes

### Phased adoption

1. **Phase A — NodeIdentity**: Assign stable IDs based on YAML path at initial parse. Thread IDs through violations. This alone fixes snippet accuracy and violation tracking. Can coexist with current pipeline.

2. **Phase B — Progression logging**: Record NodeState at each pipeline phase. Enables audit trails and enriched feedback. Requires changes to the convergence loop in `RemediationEngine`.

3. **Phase C — Unified model**: Replace the three-representation pattern (ARI tree + StructuredFile + file bytes) with `ContentGraph` as the single source of truth. Largest change, highest payoff.

### NodeIdentity derivation

```
<file-path>::<yaml-path>

Examples:
  site.yml::play[0]#task[3]
  roles/web/tasks/main.yml::task[0]
  site.yml::play[1]#block[0]#task[2]
```

YAML path is structural (based on node type and position), not content-dependent. It is assigned from the original file before any formatting and remains stable through content transforms that don't restructure the document.

### Snippet extraction with progression

```python
# At any point, a violation's snippet is trivially available:
node = content_graph.get(violation.node_id)
state = node.state_at(pass_number)  # or node.state_when_detected(violation)
snippet = state.content_lines(line - 10, line + 10)
```

### Compatibility

- `NodeIndex` (current YAML-path lookup) evolves into `ContentGraph`
- `StructuredFile` (ruamel.yaml) becomes the serialization layer for `NodeState`, not a parallel model
- `_attach_snippets` is replaced by node-level state queries
- Validators are unaffected — they still receive `ValidateRequest` with files and hierarchy
