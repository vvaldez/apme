# REQ-004: Enterprise Integration

## Metadata

- **Phase**: PHASE-003 - Enterprise Dashboard
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: 2026-03-12

## Overview

Enterprise integration capabilities including CLI tooling, web dashboard, and AAP pre-flight checks.

## User Stories

**As a DevOps Engineer**, I want CLI tooling so that I can scan locally and integrate into CI/CD.

**As a Product Manager**, I want a dashboard so that I can see "Total Errors Resolved" and "Hours Saved" metrics.

**As an AAP Administrator**, I want pre-flight checks so that non-compliant code cannot run in AAP.

## Acceptance Criteria

### CLI Tooling
- [ ] GIVEN a local environment
- [ ] WHEN `apme-scan check` runs
- [ ] THEN results are displayed in terminal and/or saved to file

### Web Dashboard
- [ ] GIVEN enterprise-wide scan data
- [ ] WHEN dashboard is accessed
- [ ] THEN aggregated metrics are displayed (errors resolved, hours saved)

### AAP Pre-Flight Integration
- [ ] GIVEN an AAP Job Template
- [ ] WHEN pre-flight check is enabled
- [ ] THEN non-compliant playbooks are blocked from execution

## Dependencies

- REQ-001: Core Scanning Engine
- REQ-003: Security & Compliance (for policy checks)

## Notes

Dashboard provides ROI visibility for Product Managers. AAP integration provides enforcement point.
