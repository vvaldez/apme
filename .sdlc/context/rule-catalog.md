# Rule Catalog

This comprehensive rule catalogue outlines ninety-three individual guidelines designed to ensure quality, security, and standardisation across automated workflows. The framework is organised into four distinct validation categories—OPA, Native, Ansible, and Gitleaks—covering critical areas such as code syntax, module deprecation, and the detection of sensitive credentials. A vital feature of this system is the inclusion of twenty deterministic fixers, which allow for the automatic correction of specific common errors. Ultimately, these rules serve as a structured roadmap for developers to maintain robust and secure configurations by transitioning from manual reviews to efficient, machine-led validations.

## Fixer Summary

Deterministic fixers (Tier 1) are auto-applied by `apme remediate`. Use `apme check --diff` to preview changes without applying. Rules without fixers fall to Tier 2 (AI-proposable) or Tier 3 (manual review).
