# Lint Rule Mapping

This documentation outlines a comprehensive standardised numbering system for Ansible code validation, where rule IDs are defined by the category of the check rather than the specific technical tool performing it. The framework transitions from legacy identifiers to a structured taxonomy including Lint (L) for style and best practices, Modernise (M) for maintaining compatibility with current ansible-core versions, and Risk (R) for security considerations. These rules are implemented through diverse methods, ranging from static syntactic analysis using OPA to dynamic runtime execution that captures accurate module metadata. Ultimately, this mapping serves as a migration guide and technical reference, ensuring that developers can consistently track, filter, and resolve policy violations across different validation engines.

---

## Rule IDs — Cross-Mapping

Rule IDs categorize the **type of check**, not the validator that runs it. The validator is an implementation detail.

| Prefix | Category | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **L** | Lint (style, correctness, best practice) | Any validator can implement an L rule |
| **M** | Modernize (keep code current with ansible-core) | Uses ansible-core runtime metadata |
| **R** | Risk/security (annotation-based) | Any validator can implement an R rule |
| **P** | Policy/validation (legacy) | Superseded by L058/L059 |

> **Note**: `src/apme_engine/validators/native/rules/rule_versions.json` includes entries for both previous (R301, R302, ...) and current (L026, L027, ...) IDs for the renumbered rules; the loader uses the current `rule_id` (L###) when looking up version info.

## OPA (Rego) Rules — L002-L025, R118

L001 was removed — its scope was limited to shell tasks without names, which is a strict subset of L024 (all tasks should have a name).

| Previous rule_id (OPA) | New ID | Description |
|------------------------|--------|-------------|

| risky-octal | L020 | mode should be string with leading zero |
| risky-file-permissions | L021 | Consider setting mode explicitly for file/copy/template |
| risky-shell-pipe | L022 | Shell with pipe should set set -o pipefail |
| run-once | L023 | Consider whether run_once is appropriate |
| name[missing] | L024 | Task should have a name |

## Ansible Validator Rules — L057-L059

These rules require an Ansible runtime (pre-built venv with ansible-core). They run in the Ansible validator service.

| Rule ID | Description | Method |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| L057 | Syntax check (`ansible-playbook --syntax-check`) | subprocess |
| L058 | Argspec validation (docstring-based: parses DOCUMENTATION string) | subprocess |
| L059 | Argspec validation (mock/patch-based: captures real argument_spec) | subprocess |

**L058 and L059** both check module arguments but use different extraction methods:

| Rule | Method | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| L058 | Parses the module's `DOCUMENTATION` string | Safe (no code execution), fast, but may drift from actual argument_spec |
| L059 | Patches `AnsibleModule.__init__` and calls `module.main()` to capture the real argument_spec | More accurate, catches `mutually_exclusive`/`required_together`/`required_if`, but executes module import code |

Both can run simultaneously; each has a unique rule ID so users can enable/disable independently.

---

## Modernize Rules — M001-M004 (Ansible Validator)

These rules use ansible-core's plugin loader (`find_plugin_with_context()`) to resolve modules against the actual runtime metadata (`ansible_builtin_runtime.yml` and collection `meta/runtime.yml`). They stay current with whichever ansible-core version is in the venv.

| Rule ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| M001 | FQCN resolution — module resolved to a different canonical FQCN |
| M002 | Deprecated module — module has deprecation metadata |
| M003 | Module redirect — module name was redirected to a new FQCN |
| M004 | Removed module — tombstoned module (raises `AnsiblePluginRemovedError`) |

> **Note**: OPA L002 also checks for non-FQCN module names but is purely syntactic (counts dot separators). M001 is semantic — it actually resolves the module via ansible-core's plugin loader. Both can fire for the same task (different rule IDs, complementary checks). M001 also works for third-party collections.

---

## Migration Rules — M005-M013 (ansible-core 2.19/2.20)

These rules detect patterns that break or behave differently under ansible-core 2.19 and 2.20. See `ANSIBLE_CORE_MIGRATION.md` for full details.

| Rule ID | Validator | Description | Fixable |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| M005 | native | Data tagging — registered var in Jinja template (untrusted in 2.19+) | Tier 2 (AI) |
| M006 | OPA | become + ignore_errors misses timeout (UNREACHABLE in 2.19+) | Yes — adds `ignore_unreachable: true` |
| M008 | OPA | Bare include: removed in 2.19+ | Yes — rewrites to `include_tasks:` |
| M009 | OPA | with_* loops deprecated | Yes — rewrites simple cases to `loop:` |
| M010 | native | Python 2 interpreter path (dropped in 2.18+) | Tier 3 (manual) |
| M011 | OPA | Network collection modules may need upgrade for 2.19+ | Tier 3 (informational) |
| — | — | M007 (nested var filters), M012 (error string parsing), M013 (smart transport) | Planned |

## Other Rule Namespaces (Unchanged)

| Namespace | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **R###** | Risk/security rules (e.g. R101, R103-R109, R111-R115, R117, R118, R401-R404, R501) remain R###. R118 is an OPA rule; the rest are native. |

| **Sample101** | Sample rule; unchanged. |

---

## Usage

- In output, violations use their rule ID directly: `L002`-`L105`, `M001`-`M004`, `R###`.
- Native (Python) lint violations include the `native:` prefix (e.g. `native:L026`) for backward compatibility.
- To map an old ID to the current one, use the tables above.
- Filtering by rule (e.g. `--rule L057`) uses the rule ID.
