  Prepare and submit a pull request for the APME project. Syncs with upstream,
  creates a feature branch, runs quality gates (tox -e lint, tox -e unit),
  updates documentation and ADRs as needed, commits with conventional commits,
  then creates the PR via gh. Use when the user asks to submit, create, or open

# PR New

## Workflow

### Step 1: Sync with upstream and create a feature branch

Always start from the latest upstream main:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b <branch-name> upstream/main
```

Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feat/add-ruff-prek`, `fix/parser-context-manager`).

If changes already exist on the current branch (e.g., from an in-progress session), cherry-pick or rebase them onto the new branch.

### Step 2: Run quality gates

```bash
tox -e lint
tox -e unit
```

**Both must pass cleanly on the full tree** — not just the files you changed.
If the branch has pre-existing violations (e.g., from an old base), rebase onto `upstream/main` first.

Do **not** run `ruff`, `mypy`, `prek`, or `pytest` directly — always use tox (ADR-047).
See the `/tox` skill for the full environment reference.

### Step 3: Update documentation

Check whether your changes affect areas covered by existing docs. Update any that apply:

| Doc | When to update |
|-----|----------------|
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | New dev workflows, setup changes, new rule patterns |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Container topology, gRPC contract changes, new services |
| `docs/DATA_FLOW.md` | Request lifecycle, serialization, payload shape changes |
| `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` | Podman pod spec, container config, env vars |
| `docs/LINT_RULE_MAPPING.md` | New or renamed rule IDs |
| `docs/DESIGN_VALIDATORS.md` | Validator abstraction changes |
| `docs/DESIGN_REMEDIATION.md` | Remediation engine changes |

If a new rule was added, regenerate the catalog:

```bash
python scripts/generate_rule_catalog.py
```

### Step 4: Update SDLC artifacts (if applicable)

If the change involves an architectural decision (new service, new protocol, new deployment strategy, new tooling adoption), create an ADR in `.sdlc/adrs/` using the `adr-new` skill. The file should follow the naming convention `ADR-NNN-slug.md`.

If open questions or decisions emerged during the session, create a Decision Request using the `dr-new` skill.

If requirements or tasks were affected, update them using the `req-new` or `task-new` skills.

The agent should invoke these skills proactively when context warrants it, informing the user of any artifacts created. All artifacts are reviewed in the PR diff.

### Step 5: Commit with conventional commits

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types for this project:

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New feature (rule, validator, CLI subcommand, service) |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Code style/formatting (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no feature or fix) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `build` | Build system, dependencies, containers |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |

Scopes reflect project areas: `engine`, `native`, `opa`, `ansible`, `gitleaks`, `daemon`, `cli`, `formatter`, `remediation`, `cache`, `proto`.

Examples:
- `feat(native): add L060 jinja2-spacing rule`
- `fix(engine): use context manager for file reads in parser`
- `build: add ruff linter and prek pre-commit hooks`
- `docs: add prek section to DEVELOPMENT.md`

### Step 6: Check branch/artifact alignment

Before pushing, verify the branch name matches the artifact IDs being committed:

```
Checking branch/artifact alignment...
- Branch: docs/req-005-aa-deprecated-reporting
- SDLC artifacts in diff: REQ-011, DR-013
```

**If mismatch detected:**
```
⚠️  Branch name contains 'req-005' but artifacts use REQ-011

Options:
1. Rename branch to match artifacts (recommended)
2. Continue with mismatched names (not recommended)

Choice (1/2):
```

If option 1 selected, use `/branch-align` to rename before pushing.

**Why this matters:** Reviewers and future contributors use branch names to find related work. A branch named `req-005` that contains `REQ-011` creates confusion.

### Step 7: Push and create the pull request

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD

gh pr create --repo upstream-owner/repo --title "conventional commit style title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Concise description of what changed and why

## Changes
- List of notable changes

## Quality of life
- List any non-functional improvements bundled in this PR: skill updates,
  workflow fixes, SDLC artifact changes, rule/template tweaks, documentation
  for contributor experience, etc.
- Omit this section entirely if there are none.

## Test plan
- [ ] `tox -e lint` passes
- [ ] `tox -e unit` passes
- [ ] Docs updated (if applicable)
- [ ] ADR added (if applicable)
EOF
)"
```

The PR targets upstream's `main` branch from the fork. Return the PR URL to the user.

### Including non-code changes (Quality of life)

PRs often include changes that are not directly part of the feature or fix but
improve the development workflow: skill updates, SDLC template tweaks, rule
improvements, documentation for contributor experience, or process fixes.

These changes belong in the **Quality of life** section of the PR body. Use
this section whenever the PR touches files like `.agents/skills/`, `.sdlc/`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SOP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or similar workflow
artifacts. This makes it easy for reviewers to separate functional changes
from process improvements.

If a PR contains **only** quality-of-life changes (no production code), use
`chore` or `docs` as the commit type.

### Maintaining the PR

When pushing additional commits to an existing PR, **always update the PR body** to reflect the new changes:

```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
...updated body...
EOF
)"
```

The Summary, Changes, and Test plan sections must stay current with all commits on the branch, not just the initial one.

### Responding to review feedback

After pushing the PR, reviewers (human or Copilot) may leave comments. Follow
the **`pr-review`** skill for the full procedure: checking CI status, replying
to comments, resolving threads, and re-checking for new Copilot reviews.
