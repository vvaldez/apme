# Podman pod (4 app containers + 1 infra; CLI on-the-fly)

Backend services run in a single **pod** so they share a network (localhost). Podman creates one extra **infra** container per pod to hold the pod’s shared network namespace, so `podman pod list` shows **5** containers (primary, ansible, opa, cache-maintainer, plus the infra container). That’s expected. The **CLI is not part of the pod** and is run on-the-fly with your current directory mounted so you can scan any project without baking a path into the pod.

## Prerequisites

- Podman
- Run all commands from the **repo root** (or use absolute paths)

## Build and start

```bash
# From repo root
./containers/podman/build.sh   # build all images
./containers/podman/up.sh      # start the pod (primary, ansible, opa, cache-maintainer)
./containers/podman/wait-for-pod.sh   # wait until pod status is Running (not Degraded)
```

Only run the health-check once the pod is **Running**. Use `wait-for-pod.sh` to wait for that, then run the health-check (or use `wait-for-pod.sh --health-check` to wait and then run the check in one step).

The pod creates:

- **Cache directory** — defaults to `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/apme` (persists across reboots). Override with `APME_CACHE_HOST_PATH=/my/cache ./up.sh`. The cache-maintainer writes here; the ansible validator reads it.
- OPA bundle is mounted from **src/apme_engine/validators/opa/bundle**.

## Run a scan (CLI on-the-fly)

From **any directory** you want to scan:

```bash
/path/to/ansible-forward/containers/podman/run-cli.sh
```

Or from the repo root, to scan a project elsewhere:

```bash
./containers/podman/run-cli.sh
# scans current directory

cd /path/to/project
/path/to/ansible-forward/containers/podman/run-cli.sh
# or with options
/path/to/ansible-forward/containers/podman/run-cli.sh --json .
```

The script mounts `$(pwd)` at `/workspace` in the CLI container and joins the pod so the CLI can reach Primary at `127.0.0.1:50051`.

## Health check

Run the health-check only after the pod is **Running** (not Degraded). Wait first, then check:

```bash
./containers/podman/wait-for-pod.sh              # wait until pod is Running
.venv/bin/apme-scan health-check --primary-addr 127.0.0.1:50051
```

Or wait and run the health-check in one step:

```bash
./containers/podman/wait-for-pod.sh --health-check
```

This checks **Primary**, **Ansible**, **Cache maintainer** (gRPC) and **OPA** (REST). Use `--json` for machine-readable output. Addresses for Ansible, Cache, and OPA are derived from the primary host (ports 50053, 50052, 8181) or set via env: `ANSIBLE_GRPC_ADDRESS`, `APME_CACHE_GRPC_ADDRESS`, `OPA_URL`.

## Stop the pod

```bash
podman pod stop apme-pod
podman pod rm -f apme-pod
```

## Troubleshooting

If the **primary** container keeps restarting (pod stays Degraded), inspect its logs:

```bash
podman logs apme-pod-primary
```

Common causes:

- **Port in use** — Ensure no other process on the host is using 50051 (or 50052, 50053, 8181). Restart the pod after stopping any conflicting services.
- **Import or runtime error** — The primary process logs exceptions to stderr before exiting; the traceback in `podman logs` will show the cause.

To run the primary container interactively to see startup errors:

```bash
podman run --rm -it --pod apme-pod -e APME_PRIMARY_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:50051 -e OPA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8181 -e ANSIBLE_GRPC_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:50053 apme-primary:latest apme-primary
```
