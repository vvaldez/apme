description: Outbound transfer (annotation-based).
scope: task
ai_prompt: |
  This rule flags outbound data transfers to parameterized URLs. Evaluate
  whether the destination is a well-known, trusted endpoint (e.g., an
  internal API, a monitoring webhook). If the transfer is intentional and
  the destination is trusted, add "# noqa: R105" — but DO NOT modify the
  task itself. Your explanation MUST justify why the destination is safe,
  e.g. "sends to internal monitoring API" or "webhook URL is defined in
  group_vars." If the destination variable could be attacker-controlled,
  flag it for the user.

## Outbound transfer (R105)

Outbound transfer to parameterized URL (annotation-based). Depends on OUTBOUND + is_mutable_dest annotation.

### Example: pass

```yaml
- name: Fixed URL request
  ansible.builtin.uri:
    url: https://api.example.com/status
    method: GET
```
