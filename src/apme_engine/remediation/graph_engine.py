"""Graph-aware remediation engine — unified Tier 1 + Tier 2 convergence.

The ``ContentGraph`` acts as a mutable working copy: transforms modify
``ContentNode.yaml_lines`` in memory, dirty nodes are rescanned with
only graph rules (no full pipeline rebuild), and files on disk are
never touched until final approval via ``splice_modifications()``.

Tier 1 (deterministic) and Tier 2 (AI) transforms participate in the
same convergence loop.  After AI applies, rescanning catches cross-tier
violations and Tier 1 cleanup runs automatically.

See :doc:`/sdlc/research/ai-as-graph-transform` for the design rationale.
