"""gRPC reporting sink -- pushes events to a Reporting service (ADR-020).

Health-gated: a background task probes the endpoint every 10 s.
When the service is marked unavailable, emit calls use a short fast-fail
timeout (1 s) so known-down endpoints don't block the scan path.
When the endpoint is healthy, the full timeout is used.
